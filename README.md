Welcome to JSMapper (jsm for short).  Jsm provides a
a handfull of utils and classes to make Beat Saber modcharting easier including,

classes for object creation (notes, walls and bombs)
classes for chroma features (light event, environment enhancments and geometry)
classes for custom events (animate tracks, path animations ect.)
utils for animation 
and filtering object utilities

# Notes and FAQs
* Currently all classes are stored in the main file that you will be scripting in, this will hopefully be addressed in a furure update but for now I will walk you through how to minimize the effect of this, see wiki
* This framework is meant for people with small amounts of coding experience, if you are more advanced I would highly reccomend Swifter1243's ReMapper
