Welcome to JSMapper (jsm for short).  Jsm provides a
a handfull of utils and classes to make Beat Saber modcharting easier including,

classes for object creation (notes, walls and bombs)
classes for chroma features (light event, environment enhancments and geometry)
classes for custom events (animate tracks, path animations ect.)
utils for animation 
and filtering object utilities

# Notes and FAQs
* All tools are stored in an npm module meaning that node.js is a requirement if you would like to use this tool
* This framework is meant for people with small amounts of coding experience, if you are more advanced I would highly reccomend [ReMapper](https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper)
